# Restaurant Project
There are some things left on the project that I would like to complete. Here is a list of those items. The list is dynamic and could change overtime:

1. Make the layout more responsive to different devices.

2. Add tool tool tips to each menu item page picture

3. Add a clickable carousell to the menu item page pictures.

4. Create a main page that has information on deals and events that are occuring at the restaurant.

5. Use javascript to find a way to create an order operation so you can order ahead of time.

6. Make a reservations section.
